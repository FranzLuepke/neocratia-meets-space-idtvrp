          <p class="card-text">
            Democracy should be liquid, not all the votes on a goverment should
            be the same. Citizens should be able to decide who has more decision
            power delegating their votes. Also, politicians must make public
            their opinion about every law and project they will vote, citizens
            should be involved on the debate so they can decide to who give
            their vote.

          <p class="card-text">
            Money movements should be transparent, politicians can't owe favors
            to corporations or rich people, they need to be free to take the
            best decisions for the people. Also, the money the goverment spends
            comes from our taxes, is our money, so we need to see where it goes,
            why it goes there and what are the projections. We are their
            investments, they need to show us the money.
